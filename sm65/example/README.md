This JSnes shit, okay? I suck at coding, and don´t want to fudge up JSnes from changing the folder name to ¨example¨ to like, ¨NES¨. So... yeah!
Also, for politeness, here´s all the credits for the emulated games:

Capcom of Japan - Creators of the Mega Man serise and Mega Man 2
-
Capcom of America - Distributors of Mega Man 2
-
Nintendo of Japan - Creators of Super Mario Brothers 1, 2 and 3. 
-

Also, you for playing it. Me for making it. Yada, yada, yada.

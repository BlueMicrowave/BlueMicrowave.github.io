# *Privacy Policy*
###### Last updated on  *January 10, 2023 4:33 EST*

Thank you for playing Drift Boss! We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have (and also because it's required by law). Because we’re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried our best to explain things in a simple and clear way. We welcome your questions and comments on this policy.

## What information do we collect?
We collect information in two ways:

1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.
When you use of products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This may include, IP address, username, profile photo, and device operating system.

You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your *GitHub* account, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your username or posted content). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

2. We also get technical information when you use our products or use websites or apps that have *GitHub* features.
These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there’s certain information that almost always gets created and recorded automatically. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect:
- IP Address
- Username of *GitHub* account
- Profile Photo
- Published Content/Source Code
- Operating System
- "Starred" Programs

## Device Information. 
In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you’re using the program on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you’re using, device settings, unique device identifiers, the IP address, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.

## How do we use the information we collect?
We will not sell any of your information to third party vendors but, we may use your given data to suspend or terminate your access at any time without notice.

## How do we make changes to this policy?
We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do, we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use the program after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.
